ICE.

We’re underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through,

heading right for us.

EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS — DUSK

ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a

frozen lake. They SING.

”The Frozen Heart (Ice Worker’s Song)”

ICE HARVESTERS:

BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR

AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING,

THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR

HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water.

ICE HARVESTERS (CONT’D)

CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.

SPLIT THE ICE APART!

AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.

Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,

share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

ICE HARVESTERS (CONT’D)

Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the

water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

ICE HARVESTERS (CONT’D)

BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!

ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They

fight it back.

ICE HARVESTERS (CONT’D)

STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN

STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!

Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

FROZEN - J. Lee

ICE HARVESTERS (CONT’D)

BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR

AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING

The sun sets. Lanterns are lit.

ICE HARVESTERS (CONT’D)

THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR

HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single

block of ice out of the water.

ICE HARVESTERS (CONT’D)

STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE.

SPLIT THE ICE APART!

BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it

pulls away.

Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a

dinky little sled then head off.

We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the

sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the

snowline...and descend upon...

EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE — NIGHT

A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.

INT. CASTLE, NURSERY — NIGHT

ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops

up beside her.

YOUNG ANNA:

Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

Elsa doesn’t stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

YOUNG ANNA (CONT’D)

Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

YOUNG ELSA:

(grumbling)

Anna, go back to sleep.

Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.

FROZEN - J. Lee

YOUNG ANNA:

(drama queen-ish)

I just can’t. The sky’s awake, so

I’m awake, so we have to play.

YOUNG ELSA:

...Go play by yourself.

Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets

an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa’s

eyelids.

YOUNG ANNA:

(mischievously)

Do you want to build a snowman?

Elsa’s eyes both pop open. She smiles.

INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE — NIGHT

Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

YOUNG ANNA:

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna’s too excited.

INT. BALLROOM — NIGHT

The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

YOUNG ANNA:

Do the magic! Do the magic!

Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly

burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.

Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out

and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching

flakes in her palms and mouth.
