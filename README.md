# Pirex
Group final project for CSC131 Software Engineering with Dr. Chidella. This project is still being continually improved upon, albeit slowly.

Pirex is a program that can quickly search for keywords (queries) within any number of files simultaneously using Apache Tika. **Think of it as a way of using CTRL-F on many files all at once.** This can be extremely useful if you are trying to find information that could be within a specific file, but you are not sure which file (out of any number of files) contains the information. 

**See supported file types here: [Supported File Types](#supported-file-types)**

With Pirex, you can add additional files, open or delete specific files, search for keywords in all uploaded files, and export the directory holding your files.

**This has been disabled in the source code for convenience of use:** Pirex also includes a login page and holds privilege levels for administrators and users to give access to different levels of functionality.


## Installation
To use Pirex as a standalone, **simply download Pirex.jar and run it.** 
Initially, it will extract a Data folder into the current directory that will hold necessary files as well as files you upload to Pirex.
If you delete this Data folder, all of your uploaded files will be gone, and the next time Pirex is ran, a fresh Data folder will be extracted.
