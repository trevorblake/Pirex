                    footage never before seen by
                    civilized humanity: a lost world in
                    South America! Lurking in the
                    shadow of majestic Paradise Falls,
                    it sports plants and animals
                    undiscovered by science. Who would
                    dare set foot on this inhospitable
                    summit?

          
          A painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer.

                    Why, our subject today: Charles
                    Muntz!

          A massive DIRIGIBLE descends on an airfield.

                    The beloved explorer lands his
                    dirigible, the "Spirit of
                    Adventure," in New Hampshire this
                    week, completing a year long
                    expedition to the lost world!

          

          

          INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

          Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
          one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    This lighter-than-air craft was
                    designed by Muntz himself, and is
                    longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
                    wagons placed end to end.

          Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
          and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And here comes the adventurer now!

          

                                                                     2.

          

          
          NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the
          gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Never apart from his faithful dogs,
                    Muntz conceived the craft for
                    canine comfort! It's a veritable
                    floating palace in the sky...

          
          An opulent dining room.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    ...complete with doggie bath and
                    mechanical canine walker.

          
          One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a
          second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
                    consider Muntz the bee's knees!
                    And how!

          
          Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
          "thumbs up" stance.

                              MUNTZ
                    "Adventure is out there!"

          In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.

                               NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    But what has Muntz brought back
                    this time?

          
          Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a
          curtained object.

                              MUNTZ
                    Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
                    of Paradise Falls!

          He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.

          

                              CROWD
                    Ooh!
          Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And golly, what a swell monster
                    this is. But what's this?

          Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.

          

                                                                        3.

          

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Scientists cry foul! The National
                    Explorers Society accuses Muntz of
                    fabricating the skeleton!

          

                                 YOUNG CARL
                    No!

          
          Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other
          famous explorers.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    The organization strips Muntz of
                    his membership.

          
          Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED
          from his jacket.
          Carl GASPS.

          
          Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly
          addresses the crowd.

          

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
                    Paradise Falls and promises to
                    capture the beast... alive!

          

                              MUNTZ
                    I promise to capture the beast...
                    alive!

          
          In the theater, young Carl smiles.

                              MUNTZ
                    And I will not come back until I do!
          The crowd CHEERS.

          
          Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible
          lifts off.

                                 NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    And so the    explorer is off to clear
                    his name.     Bon voyage Charles
                    Muntz, and    good luck capturing the
                    Monster of    Paradise Falls!
          Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.

          

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD, 1930'S - DAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of
          Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk.
          He still wears helmet and goggles.

          Carl jumps over a tree stump... and smacks into it instead.

                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    He... goes around Mount Everest!
                    Is there nothing he cannot do?

                    Yes, as Muntz himself says:
                    "Adventure is--"

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    "Adventure is out there!"
          Carl stops.   Who said that?

          
          The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up
          and lawn overgrown with weeds.
          The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to
                    starboard. Must get the Spirit of
                    Adventure over Mount Rushmore...

          

                                                                       5.

          

          
          Carl walks toward the voice.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hold together old girl. How're my
                    dogs doing? Ruff ruff!

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer.   He
          follows the voice toward the living room.

          

                              GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    All engines ahead full! Let's take
                    her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders
                    eighteen degrees towards the south.

          

          INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


          
          Carl rounds the corner to see...

          
          ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely
          visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed,
          her overalls are patched and dirty.
          The old house has been transformed into a make-believe
          dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty
          old bicycle.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    It's a beautiful day, winds out of
                    the east at ten knots.
                    Visibility... unlimited.
                        (yells a command)
                    Enter the weather in the logbook!
          The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage.

          
          Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars.

          

                              YOUNG ELLIE
                    Oh! There's something down there!
                    I will bring it back for science.
                    Awwww, it's a puppy!

          
          Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to
          the wall.

          

                               YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.)
                    No time!   A storm! Lightning! Hail!
          Ellie pops up in front of Carl.
